Key Features:

Clean Code and Architecture:

Utilizes a clean and modular codebase for enhanced readability and maintainability.
Adheres to best practices for structuring projects to ensure a scalable and organized architecture.
CQRS/MediatR Design Pattern:

Implements the CQRS design pattern to separate command and query responsibilities, leading to clearer and more maintainable code.
Leverages the MediatR library for efficient communication between components, promoting a loosely coupled architecture.
Mock Database + Unit Testing (NUnit):

Incorporates a mock database for unit testing purposes, allowing developers to test components in isolation.
Unit tests are implemented using the NUnit testing framework, ensuring reliable and automated testing of individual units of code.
Real Database & Repository Pattern:

Integrates a real database for persistent data storage, supporting the requirements of a production environment.
Implements the Repository Pattern to abstract data access logic, promoting code reusability and testability.
Many-to-Many Relationship:

Represents a Many-to-Many relationship in the database schema, showcasing the ability to handle complex data relationships.
Utilizes effective database design practices to manage and query data in scenarios involving multiple entities.
